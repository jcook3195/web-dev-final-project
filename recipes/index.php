								<h2 class="recipe-title">BLACK BEAN AND SWEET POTATO BURRITOS</h2>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<li>2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed small (about 3-4 cups)</li>
										<li>1 jalapeno, seeded and finely diced</li>
										<li>1 red pepper, diced small</li>
										<li>1 small red onion, diced small (about 1/2 cup)</li>
										<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
										<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
										<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
										<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
										<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
										<li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drain</li>
										<li>1/4 – 1/2 cup chopped cilantro (depending on your taste)</li>
										<li>2 teaspoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 lime)</li>
										<li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
										<li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
										<li>6-8 burrito-size tortillas (whole wheat, white or other favorite variety)</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss together the sweet potatoes,
									 jalapeno, red pepper and red onion with the olive oil, cumin, chili powder, salt and
									 pepper. Dump the coated veggies onto a large rimmed baking sheet and roast for 18-20
									 minutes, tossing halfway through. The vegetables should be tender but not mushy at the
									 end of cooking time.
									Let the vegetable mixture cool. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl and toss with the
									 black beans, cilantro and lime juice. Taste the mixture and add additional salt and 
									 pepper to taste, if needed. Refrigerate the mixture until ready to assemble the burritos
									 or use immediately.
									Place 3-4 tortillas on a microwave-safe plat and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave
									 for 15-20 seconds until the tortillas are pliable. Place 1/4 cup or so of the vegetable 
									 mixture in the center of the tortilla and top with a sprinkle with shredded cheese, a 
									 little of each kind.. Fold in the sides of the tortilla and roll up. Place seam-side down
									 on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining tortillas until you have all the burritos you
									 need (the filling can be refrigerated and used for 3-4 days).
									Bake in a 375 degree F oven for about 10-15 minutes, until heated through and the top of the
									 tortilla is golden brown. Adjust the baking time as needed depending on if the filling has
									 been refrigerated or not. For a softer tortilla, wrap each burrito in tin foil and heat 
									 through. Serve immediately.</p>

								<h2 class="recipe-title">CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD WRAPS</h2>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<li>1/4 cup light or regular mayonnaise</li>
										<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
										<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from about 1 large lemon)</li>
										<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>

										<li>1 romaine lettuce heart (about 6 ounces), torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
										<li>4 (10-inch) whole-grain tortillas or wraps</li>
									</ul>

								<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the mayo, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce,
									mustard and garlic. Whisk in the olive oil slowly until thoroughly incorporated.
									In a large bowl, toss the chicken and lettuce with the dressing. Divide the chicken/lettuce
									mixture evenly among the tortillas or wraps. Roll and secure with a toothpick, if desired.

								<h2 class="recipe-title">GREEK MEATBALL PITA</h2>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<h3>TZATZIKI SAUCE:</h3>
										<li>1/2 cup grated seedless, English cucumber</li>
										<li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
										<li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
										<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
										<li>Pinch black pepper</li>
										<li>1 to 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
										
										<h3>MEATBALLS:</h3>
										<li>1/2 cup bread crumbs</li>
										<li>1/3 cup milk</li>
										<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
										<li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
										<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
										<li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
										<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
										<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
										<li>1 1/2 pounds ground turkey</li>
										
										<h3>PITAS + TOPPINGS:</h3>
										<li>4 whole wheat pita breads</li>
										<li>2 large tomatoes, sliced</li>
										<li>2 cups fresh spinach, arugula or a combination</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<p>For the tzatziki, place the grated cucumber in the center of a clean kitchen towel.
									Roll up the towel and squeeze out the excess water from the cucumber. Place the 
									cucumber in a medium bowl. Add the yogurt, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon juice.
									Stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. This can be made several
									days in advance.
									For the meatballs, preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly
									grease the foil with cooking spray.
									In a medium bowl, stir together the bread crumbs and milk and let the mixture sit for a 
									few minutes to let the crumbs soften. Add the parsley, egg, oregano, garlic, salt, and 
									pepper. Stir to combine. Add the turkey and mix until well combined.
									Portion the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls and place ½-inch apart on the prepared 
									baking sheet.
									Bake for 15 minutes until the meatballs are no longer pink in the center.
									To serve, slice the pita breads in half. Dollop a spoonful of tzatziki sauce on the bottom
									of each pita. Add a layer of tomatoes and greens. Stuff meatballs inside and serve.</p>

								<h2 class="recipe-title">SMOKED TURKEY CLUB PANINI</h2>
								<div>
									<ul>
										<li>8-12 slices bacon</li>
										<li>1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil, rinsed, patted dry and minced</li>
										<li>1/3 cup light mayonnaise</li>
										<li>8 slices thick-cut crusty bread</li>
										<li>1/2 pound thinly sliced deli Swiss cheese</li>
										<li>1/2 pound thinly sliced deli smoked turkey</li>
										<li>3 cups baby spinach or arugula</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<p>Cook bacon until crisp. You can use a skillet or use the microwave, placing the bacon
									in a single layer on a paper-towel lined plate, cover with paper towels and microwave
									for about 5 minutes (repeating the process if all the bacon doesn’t fit the first round).
									In a small bowl, combine the sun-dried tomatoes and mayonnaise.
									Lightly spread butter over one side of each bread. Lay the butter-sides down on a cutting
									board or work area. Spread each slice with the sun-dried tomato mayonnaise. Layer half of
									the cheese on 4 slices of bread then top with turkey, bacon, spinach (or arugula) and 
									remaining cheese. Top with remaining bread, butter side up.
									Cook the sandwiches on a panini press, skillet or grill pan heated on medium heat for one
									minute prior to cooking. I use an indoor grill pan for my paninis but a skillet would 
									work just as well. I place 2-3 sandwiches (depending on the size of the sandwich) in the
									grill pan and weigh the sandwiches down with a heavy pot (you can also use a foil-covered
									brick or similar object). Cook the sandwiches for about 4-5 minutes per side, until they 
									golden brown and the cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining sandwiches. Serve immediately.</p>
